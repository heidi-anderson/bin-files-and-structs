# bin-files-and-structs
This is the fourth homework in CSC 215

This program was written to assist a hypothetical supervisor with giving yearend bonuses. The hypothetical supervisor has decided that for every star that an employee has gotten over the year, he will get 500 dollars. The program handles command line arguments in which the name of a binary file containing all employees and their IDs is supplied. If an ID deserving of a bonus is found, 500.00 will be added to his bonus.
